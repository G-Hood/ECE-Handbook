The last frontier of the biological sciences—
the ultimate challenge—is to understand the
biological basis of consciousness and the brain
processes by which we feel, act, learn, and remember.
During the past few decades, a remarkable unification
within the biological sciences has set the stage for address-
ing this great challenge. The ability to sequence genes
and infer the amino acid sequences of the proteins they
encode has revealed unanticipated similarities between
proteins in the nervous system and those encountered
elsewhere in the body. As a result, it has become possible
to establish a general plan for the function of cells, a plan
that provides a common conceptual framework for all of
cell biology, including cellular neural science.
The current challenge in the unification within
biology is the unification of psychology—the science
of the mind—and neural science—the science of the
brain. Such a unified approach, in which mind and
body are not seen as separate entities, rests on the view
that all behavior is the result of brain function. What
we commonly call the mind is a set of operations car-
ried out by the brain. Brain processes underlie not only
