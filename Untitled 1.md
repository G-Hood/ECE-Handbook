8 Part I / Overall Perspective
If one is interested in learning, perception, and explo-
ration, then an analysis of systems of circuits and brain
regions is likely to be required.
The goal of modern neural science is to integrate
all of these specialized levels into a coherent science.
The effort forces us to confront new questions. If men-
tal processes can be localized to discrete brain regions,
what is the relationship between the functions of those
regions and the anatomy and physiology of those
regions? Is one kind of neural circuit required to pro-
cess visual information, another type to parse speech,
and yet another to sequence movements? Or do circuits
with different functions share common organizational
principles? Are the requisite neural computations best
understood as operations on information represented
by single neurons or populations of neurons? Is infor-
mation represented in the electrical activity of individ-
ual nerve cells, or is it distributed over ensembles such
that any one cell is no more informative than a random
bit of computer memory? As we shall see, questions
about levels of organization, specialization of cells, and
localization of function recur throughout neural science.
To illustrate these points we shall examine how
modern neural science describes language, a distinc-
tive cognitive behavior in humans. In so doing, we
shall focus broadly on operations in the cerebral cortex,
the part of the brain that is most highly developed in
humans. We shall see how the cortex is organized into
functionally distinct regions, each made up of large
groups of neurons, and how the neural apparatus of a
highly complex behavior can be analyzed in terms of
the activity of specific sets of interconnected neurons
within specific regions. In Chapter 3, we describe how
the neural circuit for a simple reflex behavior operates
at the cellular level, illustrating how the interplay of
sensory signals and motor signals leads to a motor act.
Two Opposing Views Have Been Advanced on
the Relationship Between Brain and Behavior
Our views about nerve cells, the brain, and behavior
emerged during the 20th century from a synthesis of
five experimental traditions: anatomy, embryology,
physiology, pharmacology, and psychology.
The 2nd century Greek physician Galen proposed
that nerves convey fluid secreted by the brain and spi-
nal cord to the body’s periphery. His views dominated
Western medicine until the microscope revealed the
true structure of the cells in nervous tissue. Even so,
nervous tissue did not become the subject of a special
science until the late 1800s, when the Italian Camillo
Golgi and the Spaniard Santiago Ramón y Cajal
produced detailed, accurate descriptions of nerve cells
but reached two quite different conclusions of how the
brain functions.
Golgi developed a method of staining neurons
with silver salts that revealed their entire cell structure
under the microscope. Based on such studies, Golgi
concluded that nerve cells are not independent cells
isolated from one another but instead act together in
one continuous web of tissue or syncytium. Using
Golgi’s technique, Ramón y Cajal observed that each
neuron typically has a cell body and two types of pro-
cesses: branching dendrites at one end and a long,
cable-like axon at the other. Cajal concluded that nerv-
ous tissue is not a syncytium but a network of discrete
cells. In the course of this work, Ramón y Cajal devel-
oped some of the key concepts and much of the early
evidence for the neuron doctrine—the principle that
individual neurons are the elementary building blocks
and signaling elements of the nervous system.
In the 1920s the American embryologist Ross
Harrison showed that the dendrites and axons grow
from the cell body and do so even when each neuron
is isolated from others in tissue culture. Harrison also
confirmed Ramón y Cajal’s suggestion that the tip of
the axon gives rise to an expansion, the growth cone,
which leads the developing axon to its target, either
to other nerve cells or muscles. Both of these discov-
eries lent strong support to the neuron doctrine. The
final definite evidence for the neuron doctrine came in
the mid-1950s with the introduction of electron micros-
copy. A landmark study by Sanford Palay unam-
biguously demonstrated the existence of synapses,
specialized regions of nerve cells that permit chemical
or electrical signaling between them.
Physiological investigation of the nervous system
began in the late 1700s when the Italian physician and
physicist Luigi Galvani discovered that muscle and
nerve cells produce electricity. Modern electrophysi-
ology grew out of work in the 19th century by three
German physiologists—Johannes Müller, Emil du
Bois-Reymond, and Hermann von Helmholtz—who
succeeded in measuring the speed of conduction of
electrical activity along the axon of the nerve cell and
further showed that the electrical activity of one nerve
cell affects the activity of an adjacent cell in predictable
ways.
Pharmacology made its first impact on our under-
standing of the nervous system and behavior at the end
of the 19th century when Claude Bernard in France,
Paul Ehrlich in Germany, and John Langley in England
demonstrated that drugs do not act randomly on a cell,
but rather bind to discrete receptors typically located
in the cell membrane. This insight led to the discovery
