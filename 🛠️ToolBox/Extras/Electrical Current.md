>[!summary] Summary
>Electrical Current rate of electron flow per unit time. That is to say, it's a measure of the units of charge in **coulombs** passing through a cross-section of a conductor per second. The charge on an [[Electron|electron]] in coulombs is:
>$$ -1.602*10^{-19} C $$

>Units: Amps (A)
>Unit Derivations: $$ A=\frac{C}{s}=\frac{Coulombs}{Second}$$
>Flow of Current:
>$$i(t) = \frac{dq(t)}{dt} = \frac{\text{change in charge}}{\text{change in time}} $$
>
>$$ q(t) = \int $$
