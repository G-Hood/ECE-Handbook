## ECE Handbook
Welcome to the ECE Handbook a comprehensive collection of notes and exercises for ECE Students, mainly covering the curriculum and books used at Virginia Tech. 

>[!caution] Warning
>*All lectures and Homework's provided on canvas and in class are considered intellectual property of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, as such no contributions to the ECE Handbook should directly come from materials distributed by the University without explicit consent from the Professor or department*.

>[!important] Linking
>The primary benefit of notes in obsidian is the ability to link notes. The idea behind the ECE handbook is that if a student is stuck on a concept in any class including an upper level 3000 or 4000 level course. They will be able to correct their understanding by reviewing corresponding notes and jumping down the rabbit hole to clarify any misunderstanding in underlying concepts. So linking is very important.

>Guidelines for Linking: **tbd**


>[!summary] Structure
>*to be amended*
>
>**Classes:**
>To provide uniformity throughout all the different classes, they should all follow the same structure. 2 Key Elements:
>1. Notes
>2. Practice Problems Folder
>
>Contained in the topic folder, should be notes that correspond(without being explicit) to lectures, chapters in the textbook, or a specific topic (as it may be outlined in the syllabus). There is also a category for Textbooks, which if applicable try to embed the textbook notes into the class notes or at least reference.
>
>In the practice Problems folder, this may include either problems found in the back of textbooks, or practice problems created through individual effort. Along with this should be hints and solutions. When Appropriate *"lecture"* notes may benefit from embedding corresponding practice problems within the note.
>
>A sample for Practice Problems: [[Sample Practice Problem|Sample]] (Minus the weird ass audio recording that, ignore that plz)
>
>**Textbooks:**
>
>Textbooks follow a similar structure as class notes, except rather than two folders it is all contained under the singular folder for that given textbook. With A Note for a given chapter, and an additional note for that that given chapters review questions/practice problems.
>
>Practice problems for textbooks follow the same format given in the sample for classes.
