>[!example] What we Know
>We wish to determine the pressure generated between the screens as a function of the applied voltage, and to determine limits of operations to avoid arcing. 
>**The Pipe**
>- smooth
>- Non-conducting
>- circular cross-section
>- Radius - 70 micro meters
>- Distance apart - 0.8 mm
>- Extend beyond the cross section of pipe | Fringing fields may be neglected
>- Voltage between plates limited to 5 V
>**The Liquid**
>- Charge density of +30 microcoulomb per cubic meter
>- Ideal dielectric | Negligible conductivity & Negligible Viscosity
>- Experiences Dielectric Breakdown if EFI at any point in pump is 3.5 kV/m

Given the Above characteristics we should be able to determine the pressure generated, while also being able to account for limits of operation. **While accommodating for the uncertainty in relative permittivity.**

>[!todo] Tips
>- Pressure is Force over Area. $$P = F/A $$
>- Use Dimensional Analysis to Detect/Avoid errors.

## Work

#### Thoughts
So the problem statement is similar to that of a parallel plate capacitor. We have 2 plates 0.8 mm apart and we have a liquid being used as a dielectric.
