## Class Notes - Signals

**Signals** - (physical quantity)

>[!info] Signal Classifications
> **Continuous Time Signal**
> - Signal defined for all time events in given time interval \[t1,t2].
> - Can be **reconstructred** using suitable filtering techniques from discrete time signals
> 
> **Discrete Time Signal**
> - Signal defined over a discrete set of time events x\[n] (sequence/series of numbers)
> - Can be obtained by **sampling** a continuous time signal
> 
> **Analog Signal**
> - Continuous time Signal $$ x(t) \epsilon [a,b]$$
> 
**Digital Signals**
> - Discrete time signals can take only values from a discrete set
>
>**Real & Complex Signals**
>- If numbers used $$x(t), x(n) \epsilon R$$ (set of real numbrs)
>- If x(t) and x(n) are complex, the set is of complex numbers
>
>**Deterministic Signals** 
>- x(t), x(n) - completely specified at any given instant. There is no ambiguity in retrieving / viewing / measuring the signal.
>
>**Random Signals**
>- Can take random values at different time instances
>- Example, noise.
>**Even Signal**
>- x(t) = x(-t) or x\[n] = x\[-n]
>- Examples are AC signals such as cosine 
>
>**Odd Signal**
>- x(-t) = -x(t)           ex. sine function
