## What is Deep Learning


>[!summary]- How it All Works
>While doing this by hand would be nearly impossible with AI or Machine Learning, we can pick apart images piece by piece. First taking note of the low level features, the little lines and pixels, and training the algorithm to understand that these lines and pixels are part of a feature, such as a hand, ear, eye, etc.

Once we've trained it to use the small lines to see the pattern based on small lines, we can assemble it to identify a face.

It's similar to building a CPU or Computer, we start by just understanding the small single transistor, but after specifying a bunch of transistors into different orientations, we get logic gates, blocks, CPUs and Computers.

## Neural Networks

With a fundamental understanding of what is a Perceptron. We can assemble this concept, into creating neural networks.
