### Functional Completeness

>[!summary] 
>A set of logic gates if functionally complete if any function can be implemented using only gates from the set. Together the AND, OR, and NOT gates form a functionally complete set.

- Every Circuit function has an infinite number of circuits to perform that function
- Find the most compact circuit to complete the function


A | B | C | f
---|---|---|---

$$f(A,B,C) = \sum m(0,4,6) $$
