Given: Silicon is to be fabricated with a hole concetration of

$$ p_o = 2 *10^{17}\space cm^3 $$
What is intrinsic carrier concentration in Silicon at room temperature?

To make this silicon, should boron or arsenic be added to the intrinsic silicon?

	Boron to add more holes

What concentration of impurity atoms must be added?

$$ p = N_A=holes \space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space \space\space\space\space\space\space\space 2*10^{17}\space atoms^3$$
