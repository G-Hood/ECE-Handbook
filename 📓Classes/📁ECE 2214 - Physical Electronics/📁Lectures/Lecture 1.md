## Brief History of Electronics

#### The Vacuum Tubes
	[[Vacuum Tubes]], invented in **1904** by [[John Fleming]], were the predecessor to transistors, working by using heated filaments for [[Thermionic Emission|thermionic emission]]. However, these were quite flawed coming with many unfavorable aspects, such as getting **extremely hot**, being physically large, very fragile, and to top it off, they were fairly expensive.
