>- A **MOSFET** is simply a **Voltage-Controlled Switch** or a **Voltage-Controlled Resistor**
>- MOSFET stands for <u>**M**</u>etal-<u>**O**</u>xide-<u>**S**</u>emiconductor <u>**F**</u>ield <u>**E**</u>ffect <u>**T**</u>ransistors
>- R<sub>DS</sub> is one of the loss mechanism (Internal Resistance)
>- Steps of MOSFET Cap | Accumulation | Depletion | Inversion | Saturation
>- During Accumulatio, the MOS accumulates holes. 
>- Pinch off (REVIEW)
>- During Depletion the accumulated holes move away due to the effects of the Electromagnetic field.
>- During Inversion electron layers form a conduction path.
>- Basically two diodes facing apart, before inversion
>- Essentially a resistor after inversion.
