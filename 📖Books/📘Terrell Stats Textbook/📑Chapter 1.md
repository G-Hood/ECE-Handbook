## Introduction

The real world is often very different from what science tells us, in fact our understanding of the world is built upon models. However, while these models may not be 1:1 with reality, they often give us some serious predictive power and are extremely useful.

One such example is, **[Ohm's Law](Ohm's%20Law)**. $V=IR$ describes the voltage as it relates to current and resistance and given any two out of 3 values we can solve for the remaining one. This principle is applied often to find the resistance of a resistor, current through a node, etc. However, as you might find, real electricity is not as linear as Ohms law, and each individual electron doesn't operate as ohms law describes it. However, on average and given a certain boundary of circumstances, Ohms law accurately models electricity.  #revise


While simple laws like Ohms law often give us the predictive power we need. When faced with issues on larger or much smaller scales *(such as [Transmission Lines](Transmission%20Lines) or [[Microchips]])* or with elements exhibiting non-linear behavior (*such as [[Diodes]]*), we can use statistical methods to model these situations and make predictions.
