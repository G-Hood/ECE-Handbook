## Key Notes

- The importance of electromagnetics and analysis of it all comes at extremely high frequencies, at lower frequencies such as 60 Hz or even 5 MHz, the wavelength of a signal is very large, such as 100 m for a 3 MHz wave, and even larger for the 60 Hz wave. In these cases the signal isn't much different as it travels along the circuit, especially in small circuits where its all in the space of a few centimeters. However, as frequency gets increasingly long or the size of the circuit gets increasingly big (such as [[Transmission Lines]]). We can't as easily apply the lump some model, where V=IR and have to take into account phase and magnitude. 
- At higher frequencies, there isn't as much of the same signal at each location in the circuit as different parts of the circuit are experiencing drastically different phase and magnitude.
- The behavior at these frequencies is non-neglible, however, it is by it's self just a change in behavior, a new feature per se, and should be analyzed as such. Analyzed in how we can reduce the effects of this behavior, and how we can exploit the behavior, to do fun stuff.

## Key Notes

- While most theories model well practical applications of electromagnetics, classical physics starts to fall apart at very high frequencies. As the wavelengths become small enough that quantum effects have a significant impact. This occurs mainly in the X-Ray band and a higher frequencies 
$$ {X-Ray\space Band }\space | \space 3*10^{16} Hz - 3 * 10^{19} Hz $$*

## Formulas


**Wavelength**

$$ \lambda = \frac{c}{f} $$
*The wavelength of a electromagnetic field is equal to the speed at which an electromagnetic field propagate, (c) aka the speed of light, divided by the frequency*
