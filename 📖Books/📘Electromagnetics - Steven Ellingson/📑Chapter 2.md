>[!summary] Summary
>Simply put, a field is the continuum of values of a quantity as a function of position and time. This means that given a field, or something creating a field, for every position in space there is a value associated with that field. This field is representative of some quantity, for example, in electromagnetics the field is representative of the force exerted by the electromagnetic field at a position in space.

In Electromagnetics a field is represented by **E**, representing the electric field intensity as a [[Number System|real-valued]] [[Vector|vector]] field that varies with position and time. 

>[!important] Key Notes:
>E is usually represented with position and time, such as E(x,y,z,t). However E can also be noted in polar form such that E(r, t). **When E is in polar form the quantity is complex-valued, however it exhibits no time dependence**

## Sec 2.3 - Permittivity

>[!summary] Summary
>Permittivity is the materials effect on the electric field in response to an electric charge. 


In a vacuum permittivity is:
$$ \epsilon = \epsilon _0 $$
Where:
$$ \epsilon _0 = 8.854 * 10^{-12} \frac{F}{m} $$
Relative Permittivity is:
$$ \epsilon _r = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon _0} $$
