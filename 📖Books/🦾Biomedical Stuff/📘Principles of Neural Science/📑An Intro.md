# Intro

>[!important] Fast Facts!
>- The human brain consists of a network with more than 80 billion [[Nerve|nerve cells]] connecting to make a [[Neural Circuit|neural circuit]] 
>- Innate and environmental factors govern the creation of the neural circuit, but may also used to modify it through [[Experience-Dependent|experience-dependent]] changes in [[Gene Expression|gene expression]]. 

>[!example] Uh What?
>- The specificity of the synaptic connections established
during development and refined during experience underlie behavior

# Overall Perspective
>[!summary] Summary
>In the section titled "Overall Perspective" we begin to explore the topic and field of neural science. It begins by going over the history of the field and how we have more recently switched from focusing on the body and genes to a greater focus on the neural biology, to learn more about how we think, feel, perceive, learn, and all the other functions that make us conscious human beings.
>
>The author then poses several questions that we may seek to answer through the study of neural science, such as what governs memory, how is the computational power distributed throughout the organ, how can our mind develop and change throughout our life times, etc.
