>[!important] Fast Facts!
>- The human brain consists of a network with more than 80 billion [[Nerve|nerve cells]] connecting to make a [[Neural Circuit|neural circuit]] 
>- Innate and environmental factors govern the creation of the neural circuit, but may also used to modify it through [[Experience-Dependent|experience-dependent]] changes in [[Gene Expression|gene expression]]. 

>[!example] Uh What?
>- The specificity of the synaptic connections established
