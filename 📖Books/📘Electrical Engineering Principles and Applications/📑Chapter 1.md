>[!summary] Section Summary

>[!example] Section
As Electrical Engineers, we study and practice a control over electricity, obviously, it's in the name. But what exactly does that mean or what does that entail? What does it mean to control electricity? In practice their are two main areas of focus.
>1. **Distribute, Store, and Convert**
>2. **Gather, store, process, transport, and present information**
>   
The first is, how we control the flow of electricity and the flow of energy. For example, powering a computer requires many levels of control, making sure each component in the system gets the amount of energy/power it requires to function, and all of this power comes from a single battery. It

## 1.2 - Circuits, Currents, and Voltages

>[!summary] Section Summary
>An **Electrical Circuit** is a circuit which typically consists of various [[Circuit Element|circuit elements]](resistors, capacitors, inductors..., etc) which control [[Electrical Current|current]] and [[Voltage|voltage]] in a closed path, which is connected by [[Conductor|conductors]].

>In the above picture, we see an example of a simple resistive circuit. Starting from the positive end of the voltage source *(**V**)* , electrons travel through the resistors, into the negative end of the circuit, making a complete circuit. At the bottom of the circuit, we see the upside down triangle indicating the [[Ground|rail]].

>>It's important to remember that V=IR is an empirical model that makes design and analysis of circuits easy. In reality, electrons and the interactions between them and our circuits is much MUCH more complex.
