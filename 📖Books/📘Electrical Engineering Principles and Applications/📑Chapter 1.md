>[!summary] Section Summary

>[!example] Section
As Electrical Engineers, we study and practice a control over electricity, obviously, it's in the name. But what exactly does that mean or what does that entail? What does it mean to control electricity? In practice their are two main areas of focus.
>1. **Distribute, Store, and Convert**
>2. **Gather, store, process, transport, and present information**
>   
The first is, how we control the flow of electricity and the flow of energy. For example, powering a computer requires many levels of control, making sure each component in the system gets the amount of energy/power it requires to function, and all of this power comes from a single battery. It

## 1.2 - Circuits, Currents, and Voltages

>[!summary] Section Summary
>An **Electrical Circuit** is a circuit which typically consists of various [[Circuit Element|circuit elements]] which control [[Current|current]] and [[Voltage|voltage]] in a closed path, which is connected by [[Conductor|conductors]].
