>In this chapter we will discuss techniques for circuit analysis which build upon the basic theories relayed in the previous chapter


## 2.4 - Kirchhoff's Laws

>[!summary] [[Kirchhoff's Laws#Kirchhoff's First Law|Kirchhoff's First Law]]
>This law is based on the conservation of charge, which shows that the sum of charges within a system cannot change. This is basically saying that ignoring parasitic losses, the electrons in a system remain in the system. This means that at any point in a circuit the charges entering that node, must equal the charges leaving that node. **The algebraic sum of charges for any given node MUST be equal to 0.** 
>$$ \sum_{n=1}^N i_n = 0 $$
>The above equation algebraically describes this principle. For N number of branches the sum of currents 1 to N, must be equal to 0. For usual convention this is that **current entering a node is positive**, **current leaving a node is considered negative.**

>Similar to Kirchhoff's First Law, the second law is based on the conservation of energy. This law states that the **algebraic sum of all voltage around a closed path is zero**
