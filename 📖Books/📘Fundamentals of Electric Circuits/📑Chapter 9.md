## 9.1 - Introduction 
>[!summary] Summary
>In this chapter the book begins to explore analysis of circuits which are excited by constant and time-invariant sources, or more simply AC Circuits. In particular this chapter focuses on the excitation of a circuit caused by a **[[ðŸ“‘Chapter 9#9.2 - Sinusoids|Sinusoid]]**, also known as **Alternating Current**. This type of excitation is defined by a current which alternates at regular intervals between positive and negative values. This can be intuitively thought of using a pendulum, as the pendulum swings one way it reaches it's peak amplitude, and reverse swinging to roughly the same peak on the opposite side, in the case of AC, this is simply the current swinging between positive and negative, at a regular interval.

>This concept is of particular interest to our study, as such signals and motion are quite common in nature. For example, the pendulum as previously stated, due to inertia and gravity, the movement vectors swings positively and negatively at a set interval to a specific amplitude, only slowing due to outside forces such as friction.

#### Brief History of DC vs. AC
Up until the late 1800's DC was the dominant power source used championed by the famous inventor [[Thomas Edison]]. However, during the late 1800's, as uses for electricity began to advance, **AC was found to be more efficient and economical for use over long distances**. 
## 9.2 - Sinusoids

>[!summary] Summary
>Sinusoidal Voltages may all be defined of the basic fundamental form:
>$$ v(t) = V_m sin(\omega t) $$
>Where:
>$$V_m \text{= the amplitude of the sinusoid}$$
>$$ \omega \text{= the angular frequency in radians/s }$$



#### Properties of Sinusoids

>Remember:
>$$\omega = 2 \pi*f\text{ | Where f = frequency} $$
>and the Period T:
>$$ T= \frac{2\pi}{\omega} $$


## 9.3 - Phasors

>[!summary] Summary
>Phasors are another way we can represent sinusoids and provide us a powerful tool in the analysis of sinusoids. Put simply **a phasor is a complex number that represents the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid**.
