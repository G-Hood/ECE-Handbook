A zero of the transfer function
$$ H(s) = \frac{10(s+1)}{(s+2)(s+3)} $$
is at:
(a) 10          (b) -1          (c) -2         (d) -3

>[!success]- Solution
> Answer: b
> >[!example]- Explanation
> >In the above function, H(s) is our transfer function, where s is a complex variable in the frequency domain given by the Laplace transform. In the case of finding the zero/zero's of at transfer function we need to find a value 's' such that the function 'H(s)' is equal to 0. In the above equation, by inspection, we see that at s=-1, we get:
> >$$H(s) = \frac{10(-1+1)}{(-1+2)(-1+3)}$$
> >Which gives us:
> >$$H(s) = \frac{0}{2}$$
> >$$H(s) = 0\text{ at s= -1} $$
