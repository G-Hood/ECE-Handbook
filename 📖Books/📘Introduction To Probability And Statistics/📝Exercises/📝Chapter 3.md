>[!example] Question 1.
>
>You buy a bag of 8 candies, of which 3 are chocolates, but all candies look alike. You eat candies from the bag until you have eaten all three chocolates. What is the probability you will have eaten exactly 7 of the candies in the bag?
>>[!success] Solution
>>In this question, the person is stopping when they eat 3 chocolates. Since we stop at 3 chocolates and we want to know the probability that they have eaten exactly 7 chocolates. We can say that the 7th candy is a chocolate thus:
>>$$P(X=7)= \frac{1}{2}*\text{ probability first}\frac{2}{6} \text{ are chocolate}$$
>>
>>To find the probability that 2 of the first 6 candies are chocolate, we go back to [ðŸ“‘Chapter 1](ðŸ“–Books/ðŸ“˜Introduction%20To%20Probability%20And%20Statistics/ðŸ“‘Chapter%201.md). We want to find the probability that we get 2 of the 3 chocolates when choosing 6 of 8 candies. Applying a [[Hypergeometric Probability]], we get:
>>$$ p(x)= \frac{\binom{3}{2} \binom{5}{4}}{\binom{8}{6}}*\frac{1}{2}$$
>>
