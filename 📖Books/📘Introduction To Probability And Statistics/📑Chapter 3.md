>[!summary] Summary - Random Variables
>**Discrete Random Variable Definition:** A random variable is discrete if it can assume at most a finite or countably infinite number of possible values.

>>[!example] Identifying Discrete vs Continuous
>>While hard to count, the number of stars in the sky is a discrete variable, as there are a countably infinite number of them. If we were to examine the number of blue-shifted stars we would find there to be a discrete amount. However, if we were to do a statistical analysis on the velocity of them, speed is measured continuously, in that there are an infinite number of possibilities between 0 and 1, and any other number.
