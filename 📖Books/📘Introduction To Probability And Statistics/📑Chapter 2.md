## The Foundation of Probability

>[!summary] Summary - Axioms of Probability
>Everything in probability is based on a few absolute rules/laws:
>
>**1.** $P [$[[Sample Space|S]]$] = 1$ | The probability of an event within the sample space occurring is 1.
>**2.** $P[A] \geq 0$ for every event A. | For any event within the sample space, the probability will always be greater than or equal to 0. No negative probabilities.
>**3.** Given [[ðŸ“–Books/ðŸ“˜Introduction To Probability And Statistics/ðŸ“‘Chapter 1#^4e74a4|Mutually Exclusive]] events $\{A_1, A_2, _{...}, A_n\}$  whether finite or infinite. $P[A_1 \cup A_2 \text{ }{...} \cup A_n] = P[A_1]+P[A_2] + ... + P[A_n]$ | The sum of mutually exclusive events is equal to the probability of each event occurring independently.


>[!important] Derivations of Axioms
>Given the Axioms of Probability we can derive some other rules that are simply just consequences of these given 3 rules.
