>[!summary] Introduction:
>Statistics is an extremely important concept to engineers, and is much more pervasive then one might initially think. As scientists and engineers, we don't necessarily describe how the world "is", we simply create models that give us the power to predict how the world will **behave**. These models are based on empirical data and statistics.

>>One example of this is with [[Ohm's Law]]. Where we say V= IR

>[!summary] Key Points
>- Probability is a number between 0 and 1
>- Tells how likely or unlikely an event is to occur with 1 being always and 0 being never, although most are between.
>**Three Methods** 
>- Personal Approach: Making an informed assumption as a matter of opinion, based on the evidence available. Pros: Highly Available | Cons: Not necessarily Accurate
>- Relative Frequency: $\frac{Occurrences}{Tr}
