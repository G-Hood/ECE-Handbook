>[!summary] Introduction:
>Statistics is an extremely important concept to engineers, and is much more pervasive then one might initially think. As scientists and engineers, we don't necessarily describe how the world "is", we simply create models that give us the power to predict how the world will **behave**. These models are based on empirical data and statistics.

# 1.1 What are the Odds?

>[!summary] Key Points
>- Probability is a number between 0 and 1
>- Tells how likely or unlikely an event is to occur with 1 being always and 0 being never, although most are between.

>**Three Methods** 
>- **Personal Approach**: Making an informed assumption as a matter of opinion, based on the evidence available, mostly useful in highly unique situations without precedent to make an statistical determination. Pros: Highly Available | Cons: Not necessarily Accurate
>- **Relative Frequency**: $\frac{Occurrences}{Trials}$ This method uses repeated trials, dividing the number of times an event occurs by the number of times it could've occurred. Pros: Fairly Accurate | Cons: Restricted to Events with repeatable trials
>- **Classical Approach**- This method divides the number of way a specific event can occur, by the number of ways an experiment could proceed, given all events are equally likely. **Pros: Does Not Require Experiment | Cons: Only usable when events are equally likely**
>  >[!example] Three Methods with a Coin Flip
>  >A coin will be flipped once, call heads or tails?
>  >**Personal Approach: ** "I have a feeling it'll be heads"
>  >**Relative Frequency:** I flipped this coin 10 times and I got 6 heads, and 4 tails, so heads, as there is a 0.6 probability of heads, which is slightly higher than tails. $p=\frac{6}{10}$
>  >**Classical Approach: **There are two ways it could go, and 1 way it would be heads, and 1 way it would be tails, therefore it doesn't really matter which you pick. $p=\frac{1}{2}$
