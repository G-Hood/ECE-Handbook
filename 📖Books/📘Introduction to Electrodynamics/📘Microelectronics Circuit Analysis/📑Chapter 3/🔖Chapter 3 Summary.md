#### 3.1 MOS Field-Effect Transistor
- Became practical in 1970s.
- Compared to BJT is smaller
- Requires no resistor or diode
- Extremely useful for high-density [[VLSI]]
- Responsible for the creation of the handheld calculator, personal computer, and laptop 
- Current is controlled through perpendicular electric-field to the semiconductor surface and to the direction of current
- This method of modulating the conductance is called the field effect
>[!summary] 3.1 Summary
>3.1 Discusses the history/applications of MOSFET as well as a general idea of how it works. To summarize, MOSFETS didn't become practical until the 1970's, due to being smaller than the BJT and requiring no resistors or diodes, it allows for ease of production of high-density [[VLSI]] circuits. Which has allowed for us to create devices such as the calculator and personal computers.

>The operation of a MOSFET occurs through the use of an current that is applied perpendicular to the [[Electric Field]] of the semiconductor as well as perpendicular to the direction of the current. The method is referred to as the [[Field Effect]].

##### 3.1.1 
- Heart of the MOSFET is the metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (pic 1)
- Metal can be aluminum or most other metal types 
- Metal is often replaced with high-conductivity polycrystalline silicon layer deposited on the oxide
